A curated list of various BFO and BFO-related resources.

The creation of Barry Smith, BFO is described as growing out of a philosophical orientation which overlaps with that of DOLCE and SUMO. Unlike these, however, it is narrowly focused on the task of providing a genuine upper ontology which can be used in support of domain ontologies developed for scientific research, as for example in biomedicine within the framework of the OBO Foundry. Thus BFO does not contain physical, chemical, biological or other terms which would properly fall within the special sciences domains. BFO is the upper level ontology upon which OBO Foundry ontologies are built.

## BFO
- [BFO Book](https://www.biblio.com/search.php?stage=1&author=barry+smith&title=building+ontologies+with+basic+formal+ontology) - *Building Ontologies with Basic Formal Ontology*. Essentially an in-depth tutorial of BFO's philosophical grounding and real examples of how to use it. MUST READ for a full understanding.
